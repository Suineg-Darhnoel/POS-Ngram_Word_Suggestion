# Prototypes

Based on Ngram, one of the language models, we believe 
that the sequence of consecutive words, provides sufficient 
statistical information for a machine to learn and predict the future.

Since texts are written in accordence with grammar rules,
we hope to train data based on part-of-speech ngram (POS-ngram)
as a filter for improving word suggestion system.
