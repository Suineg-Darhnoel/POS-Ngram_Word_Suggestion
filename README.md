# Prototypes

Based on n-gram model, the language indepent model, we believe 
that the sequence of consecutive words, provides sufficient 
statistical information for a machine to learn and predict the future.

Since texts are written in accordent to grammar rules,
we hopefully to train data based on part-of-speech of words
as a filter for improving word suggestion system.
