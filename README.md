# Abstract

Ngram is a type of language model for predicting the next item in a sequence. POS-Ngram is an improved model that integrates part-of-speech with the Ngram. In this study, we employ the POS-Ngram model to augment the ability of a word suggestion system to predict not only words but also provide grammatical information.
